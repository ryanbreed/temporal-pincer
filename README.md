Don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear time.

## Branching

* `/main` - principal release merge target
* `/dev`  - principal feature-publishing merge target

## Repo-level Control

* protect `/main` from forced push
* commit tags mean something
* signed tags really mean something
